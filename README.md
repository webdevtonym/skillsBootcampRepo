# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation in building this app is to complete the prework needed to advance on my course and progress to the next level to ulimately get closer to be coming a professional in web development. 

I built this project in order to teach myself the concepts of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. How they all work together and give myself the best chance of success.

This project displays a basic website that can be used by a student to take notes while learning each technology. 

I learned how to use these programming languages syncronistically while simultaniously using git and github commands to continually save my changes and build good habits that will translate when build real world applicaitons for end users.
